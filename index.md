### Okay then what the heck does Atlas do anyways?
Ooh Ohh, I have an answer for this!
First off you can view all the commands [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWtJcOIYf016UX8BXdJ6oXWkx2U8FNCaXYTzFCCr9ho/edit?usp=sharing) but that's kinda boring.

Well Atlas does a lot of things. (I put wayyyyy to many hours into this bot lmao)
But we can break it into main catagories.
1. General/Misc CMDS
2. Moderation
3. Fun Stuff!
4. Anime/Friendship
5. Economy
6. Mood logging
7. Ian NFTs (Chill out its a joke project)
8. Event/Seasonal
