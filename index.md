## A multipurpose discord bot

Already interested? [**Add Atlas to your server!**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=867920092145528853&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Okay, maybe it isn't that easy. Fair enough.

### Okay then what the heck does Atlas do anyways?
Ooh Ohh, I have an answer for this!
First off you can view all the commands [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWtJcOIYf016UX8BXdJ6oXWkx2U8FNCaXYTzFCCr9ho/edit?usp=sharing) but that's kinda boring.

Well Atlas does a lot of things. (I put wayyyyy to many hours into this bot lmao)
But we can break it into main catagories.
1. General/Misc CMDS
2. Moderation
3. Fun Stuff!
4. Anime/Friendship
5. Economy
6. Event/Seasonal

And hey just for being here, I'll break it into the most useful/popular commands for each catagory
